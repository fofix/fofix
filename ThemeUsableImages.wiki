#summary List of Usable Images for FoFiX Themes.

<wiki:comment>
What I wouldn't give for a WYSIWYG editor...
I recommend copy-pasting all this text into a text editor (with monospaced font and option to turn off word wrapping) if you intend to edit this

=Images Usable By FoFiX=

This will be a complete list of usable images that FoFiX can use.
It will list what directory they belong in, and if they are Required or if they are just usable if they exist.
<BR>An image is marked required if FoFiX crashes/freezes when the file is not present. Sometimes files are only required for specific theme types.
<BR>As at the time of writing there are 4 main theme types: RB, GH2, GH3 and GH:WT. Anything marked "GH Based" means it falls into all of GH2, GH3 and GH:WT (i.e., everything but RB)
<BR>This is WIP status until completed. Then it will just be maintained as things are added.
<BR>*As of March 1 2009, all _required_ images (i.e. those that if missing, FoFiX will crash) are listed*

==Image Format==
Sometimes FoFiX can be picky about the image format it uses. All filenames in this list are _exact_, meaning they must have the .png extension. When creating images, you must adhere to the following limerick:
<BR>
<BR>_The format for all PNGs_
<BR>_Is twenty-four bit RGB_
<BR>_Use non-interlaced_
<BR>_and avoid pallet-based_
<BR>_Or you can also rename JPGs_
<BR>
<BR>...sums it up pretty nicely, if I do say so myself.

==\menu\icon\ Directory==
This folder contains icons to be displayed next to songs in the RB2 setlist. None of these files is required, and there is no set names, as names are specified in the song.inis.
For example, if the song has the entry "icon=rb2" in its song.ini, then on the RB2 setlist next to that song it will display "\menu\icon\rb2.png". 
Similarly, if the song has the entry "icon=gobbldygook" in its song.ini, then on the RB2 setlist next to that song it will display "\menu\icon\gobbldygook.png".
<BR>Here is a list of some commonly used icon titles:
 * gh1
 * gh2
 * gh2dlc
 * gh3
 * gh3dlc
 * gh80s
 * gha
 * ph1
 * ph2
 * ph3
 * ph4
 * phm
 * rb1
 * rb2
 * rbdlc
 * rbtpk
