------------------


3.021 (2008-10-25)
------------------

Songlist Optimization


3.020 (2008-10-24)
------------------

- Fixed game freeze / hang caused by "Accuracy Words Pos" = "Center"
- Used rubjonny's FoF icon instead of the old style icon
- Fixed issue: where the song time countdown, once it reaches zero, starts counting back from 60 while the music track finishes (if it finishes after the midi, as a lot of songs do)
- Fixed issue: strumming a HOPO before pulling off to another doesn't work correctly
- Added evilynux's Timer.py patch that greatly reduces CPU usage in menus and in game
- Added basic score uploading feedback - the game will now tell you if the upload succeeded or failed
- Added logic to display resulting rank for your uploaded top score in the world chart: http://i36.tinypic.com/2cxzqyv.jpg
- Fixed HOPO markings on notes extremely close together, examples are found all over the Hell Freezes Over version of Hotel California
- Replaced all GuitarScene realtime string concatenation (slow) with % formatting (fast) -- only during gameplay (initialization concatenation is still present)
- Rewrote both Guitar and Drum starpower marking logic to occur only at initialization, not every time through the renderNotes() functions
- Rewrote starpower marking logic to only mark the actual last note as the starpower "final" instead of the entire last chord (this fixes the double drum starpower rewards)
- Prevented HOPO debug text from being rendered for drum players
  - Added optional support for theme-based failsound.ogg from worldrave's GH3 back and failed sounds
  - Added optional support for random choice between theme-based back1.ogg and back2.ogg instead of just out.ogg
- Wrote logic to stagger-mix crowd cheering sound files in a loop to create an endless cheering effect for the GameResults screen (a la GH2) if crowdcheers.ogg exists in the current theme
  - New setting under "Audio Options" -> "Results Cheer Loop" (default On) - will mix and endless loop of cheers during game results scoring
  - New setting under "Audio Options" -> "Cheer Loop Delay" (default 550) - this is the adjustable delay between mixing of a fresh crowd cheer into the loop (careful!)
- Ensured that if crowdcheers.ogg is not found, that starpower.ogg is not mixed twice whenever activating starpower
- Added slashy666's updated pause.png and editor.png to Rock Band 1 theme
- Added logic to catch a crash/hang when the game attempts to improperly delete a texture


3.017 (2008-10-17)
------------------

Fail Detection Fix

- Rewrote fail detection logic in GuitarScene.run() function to not be hardcoded for 2 players, to be compatible with future expansion


3.016 (2008-10-16)
------------------

Stages:

- alpha: 2008-10-16

Notes: Logging & Debugging Enhancements

- Enhanced "error" logfile entries to produce a helpful trace output like that created when running from sources and using an immediate / debug window (no code shown, just classes / functions / line numbers)
- fretsonfire.log file will now be created in the game folder you are running from (will appear in the same place fretsonfire.ini is created)
- Recompiled library.zip and FretsOnFire.exe from sources
- Updated GameEngine.versionstring to the correct value


3.015 (2008-10-15)
------------------

- Fixed pause layering during song countdown
- Ensured the accuracy indicator from the last note hit is not still displayed after a restart
- Ensured that just letting an entire guitar solo go by without attempting to hit any notes does not result in a 100% perfect solo
- Moved spinning star rotation angle calculation / update from Guitar render() function to run() function
- Added logic to catch when a drum chord (which counts individual notes for streak) skips a "note streak" threshold (like, from 99 to 101) and display the appropriate streak notification
- Added logic to flash the overdrive strings just before You Rock for Rock Band based themes
