[i]New since 3.017:[/i]
++Fixed game freeze / hang caused by "Accuracy Words Pos" = "Center" (SVN rev 41's GuitarScene.py)
++Used [url=http://vwtech.no-ip.info/fof/foficon.zip]rubjonny's FoF icon[/url] instead of the old style icon
++Fixed issue where the song time countdown, once it reaches zero, starts counting back from 60 while the music track finishes (if it finishes after the midi, as a lot of songs do) (SVN r42)
++Fixed Bug: Strumming a HOPO before pulling off to another doesn't work correctly - [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=25040&st=0&sk=t&sd=a&start=705#p295204]post[/url] -- (SVN r43) beta testers: [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?m1id2mudmg4]3.020 beta1[/url]
++Added evilynux's Timer.py patch that greatly reduces CPU usage in menus and in game
++Added basic score uploading feedback - the game will now tell you if the upload succeeded or failed
++++Added logic to display resulting rank for your uploaded top score in the world chart [url=http://i36.tinypic.com/2cxzqyv.jpg]SS[/url]
++Fixed HOPO markings on notes extremely close together, examples are found all over the Hell Freezes Over version of Hotel California (SVN rev 50) - beta testers: [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?nl2mom0zntq]3.020 beta 2[/url] - [url=http://rapidshare.com/files/156170256/MfhModV3_020beta2-HopoMarkingFix.rar]SmashD's rapidshare mirror[/url]
++Replaced all GuitarScene realtime string concatenation (slow) with % formatting (fast) -- only during gameplay (initialization concatenation is still present)
++Rewrote both Guitar and Drum starpower marking logic to occur only at initialization, not every time through the renderNotes() functions
++Rewrote starpower marking logic to only mark the actual last note as the starpower "final" instead of the entire last chord (this fixes the double drum starpower rewards)
++Prevented HOPO debug text from being rendered for drum players
++++Added optional support for theme-based failsound.ogg from [url=http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?yhrjmmzjxyy]worldrave's GH3 back and failed sounds[/url]
++++Added optional support for random choice between theme-based [url=http://www.zshare.net/download/50165784f1788532/]back1.ogg[/url] and [url=http://www.zshare.net/download/50165806b0683e84/]back2.ogg[/url] instead of just out.ogg
++Wrote logic to stagger-mix crowd cheering sound files in a loop to create an endless cheering effect for the GameResults screen (a la GH2) if [url=http://www.zshare.net/download/50167245e96a9c32/]crowdcheers.ogg[/url] exists in the current theme
++++New setting under "Audio Options" -> "Results Cheer Loop" (default On) - will mix and endless loop of cheers during game results scoring
++++New setting under "Audio Options" -> "Cheer Loop Delay" (default 550) - this is the adjustable delay between mixing of a fresh crowd cheer into the loop (careful!)
++Ensured that if crowdcheers.ogg is not found, that starpower.ogg is not mixed twice whenever activating starpower (SVN rev 53)
++Added [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?sharekey=03cb874335296e22ab1eab3e9fa335cafabbec8ce69f9b50]slashy666's updated pause.png and editor.png[/url] to Rock Band 1 theme
++Added logic to catch a crash/hang when the game attempts to improperly delete a texture (SVN rev 65)

[url=http://www.mediafire.com/?nn2yzkjmqyf]Patch mediafire download[/url]

[i]New since 3.005:[/i]
++Updated to Blazingamer's unofficial 3.011 w/revised Dialogs.py
++Changed default neck speed mode to "BPM & Diff" instead of "Percentage" as it more closely matches the console game behavior (and should keep speeds above the threshold where close notes overlap for the most part)
++Replaced countless player count array length function calls during gameplay with a predetermined variable
++Wrote logic to precalculate the viewport geometries and remember them instead of recalculating multiple times per frame
++Fixed themes when running from sources (the existing solution did not work for me, I changed evilynux's code src folder code to that found in GameEngine.py)
++Completely rewrote an equivalent, much simpler problematic HOPO determination logic - doesn't even need pre-marking of problematic note patterns or ANY note hunting -- beta testers: [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?2msr9fdmzn1]v3.015 beta1[/url] (packaged as a standard patch from 3.0xx)
++Replaced all gameplay text comparisons for part == "Drums" or part != "Drums" with a quicker boolean comparison using isDrum instead
++Cleaned up / rewrote faaa's drum sound code  (which contained many redundant conditionals and prevented normal random drum screwup sounds if disabled)
++Added a boolean variable to check for Bass Guitar part without string comparisons
++++Replaced all gameplay text comparisons for part == "Bass Guitar" or part != "Bass Guitar" with a quicker boolean comparison using isBassGuitar instead
++Created new function to replace multiple doPick screw-up code sections, "screwUp(playerNum)"
++Added code to precalculate rockMed and rockHi thresholds instead of the unnecessary floating-point divisions every time in the render
++Rewrote code that handles star scoring to precalculate all thresholds and use fast comparisons during gameplay -- beta testers: [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?moz53dmmmk2]3.015 beta2[/url]
++++(moved option to "Performance Settings") -- "In-Game Stats" option now is an independant lag setting: disabling stats (avg mult & overall percentage) stops calculations that are otherwise unneeded (In-Game Stars used to force enabling of the calculations)
++New option under "Performance Settings" -> "Star Updates": (default "Score Change") 
++++"On Hit" only updates star scoring when a note is hit
++++"Score Change" updates star scoring every time the score has changed (this will allow star updates during sustains)
++Added "harmonica" to solo filter for RB2: Bob Dylan - Tangled Up in Blue
++Rewrote parsing, retrieval, and handling of events from script.txt, MIDI sections, MIDI lyrics, guitar solos, and other MIDI text events, which are now organized in special event tracks, all separate from the note tracks (overall, much smaller tracks to filter and sort through during gameplay) -- beta testers: [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?duemtjyjmon]3.015 beta3[/url]
++++Fixed guitar solo note counting for solos until the end of a song, no longer will cause a divide by zero error - beta testers: 3.015 beta4 - [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?tt0qzwytmgm]Mediafire[/url], [url=http://www.usaupload.net/d/xzeuwzimmm5]USAupload[/url], [url=http://anonym.to/?http://rapidshare.com/files/152805772/MfhModV3_015beta4-FixedEndingGuitarSolos.rar]Rapidshare[/url]
++Moved star count to the Player object, and removed all redundant (and outdated) star scoring logic from the GameResults object (star score now determined only once, in GuitarScene)
++++Added code to run the final star calculation just before spawning a Game Results scene, just in case the player has in-game stars disabled
++Added new hybrid star scoring system, "RB+GH" (default now "RB+GH") - scores just like RB (with avg multiplier), but will also force gold stars if you hit every note 100%
++Rewrote all gameplay soundFX play logic to create a new sound channel and mix with currently-playing SFX instead of a single channel with only one sound at a time playing
++Wrote function to set all SFX object volumes to the set SfxVol, that can be called when un-pausing - instead of setting SFX volume before every SFX play request
++Prevented songlist Left / Right controls from entering an endless loop hunting for tier labels when there are none
++Added Blazingamer's cleaned-up neck chooser render code
++Added [url=http://paste.ideaslabs.com/show/ANRnUmEtgH]evilynux's patch[/url] containing some merging mistake fixes
++Added [url=http://paste.ideaslabs.com/show/Oe0yhMBh53]evilynux's patch[/url] that fixes two stage-related crashes
++Added [url=http://paste.ideaslabs.com/show/XhGWnX6ma1]evilynux's patch[/url] to slightly optimize a couple theme.ini color options during gameplay
++Relocated Decimal.py initialization to the actual GuitarScene initialization with global variables instead of local variables reinitialized each render()
++Moved total notes and total streak variables to the Player object (instead of the GuitarScene object) so the Game Results object doesn't have to re-calculate them
++Added [url=http://paste.ideaslabs.com/show/pPfTmgN17]evilynux's patch[/url] containing some font caching optimization
++Added evilynux's fix to the Font.getLineSpacing function
++Fixed guitar solo issue with GH1 - Anarchy Club - Behind The Mask (guitar solo start & end at same exact position) -- Added "chorus" to list of GH1-style solo end markers, and added logic to ensure guitar solo start and stop cannot be recognized at the exact same position in the song
++++Added logic to prevent multiple consecutive section events to be added to the exact same time
++Added [url=http://paste.ideaslabs.com/show/0lvX4GyoGT]evilynux's patch[/url] that fixes song previews
++Added evilynux's View.py geometry integer warning fixes
++Added [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=11;t=30757;st=650#entry329343]evilynux's changes[/url] which organize the fretsonfire.ini file
++Removed TWO unnecessary note object list retrieval operations (sorting & filtration) from the run() function
++Added code to support animated stages when running from sources
++Organized the render() function to minimize switching between setViewport and setViewportHalf each frame (several switches back and forth are currently taking place)
++Relocated several inappropriate sections of code from the GuitarScene render() function to the run() function - so they are no longer dependant on video framerate:
++++Moved missed starpower note detection
++++Moved rockmeter tracking logic
++++Moved scaling phrase handling logic
++++Moved killswitch processing logic
++++Moved animated / rotating stage frame change logic 
++Prevented reservation of a special "sound FX" channel, which wastes a channel with the new system of playing each sound on an unused channel for mixing
++Rewrote player-indexed list initializations that must remain in GuitarScene, to be more compatible with a future 3-player mode (i.e. not hardcoded for 2-players)
++++Rewrote and reorganized the majority of the GuitarScene.run() function
++++Rewrote rockmeter calculations and starpower note miss detection algorithms to NOT: use a hard-coded 2 players and force all related variables to represent 2 players even in a solo game
++++Rewrote Faaa's drum sound playing and hit-ignoring logic
++++Changed Faaa's "Drums sound" setting to "Drum Misses", (default "First Note"):
++++++"Always" is the old default - this will always register drum misses
++++++"Song Start" will allow you to bang away freestyle on the drums until the song countdown is complete (when the song actually starts)
++++++"First Note" will allow you to bang away freestyle on the drums until the first drum note in the song appears (default)
++Rewrote phrase-handling code to truly support two players (currently, only one scaling phrase can be displayed on one of the players fretboards at a time)
++Moved RB overdrive ready glow fadein / fadeout calculation from GuitarScene.render() to GuitarScene.run()
++++Rewrote RB overdrive ready glow display logic in GuitarScene.render()
++Moved Get Ready to Rock, start countdown, song info during countdown, and song time left code to display on top of everything else (some were hidden by various parts of the 2-player screen)
++Added new option to "Game Time" setting: "Elapsed" will display song time as an increasing value, starting at 0:00 and ending at the length of the song
++Ensured reset of scaling text's display timer whenever new text is set (now setting the displayText involves calling a function instead of just changing the text)
++++New translatable string, for Pro Face-Off mode, "You Failed!!!!" (was not translatable before)
++Added new options to the settings for "MIDI/RB Lyrics" and "MIDI/RB Sections": "1p Only" (new defaults = "1p Only")(will only enable lyrics or sections when in a single-player game; multiplayer games will disable these features to improve performance)
++Added a "Preparing..." (new translatable string) loading screen to display as soon as the song starts initializing for gameplay - so that the loading screen comes up quicker and stays up for more of the actual loading time
++Added a new responsive loading screen to the songlist loads - now compatible with the new synchronous loading
++Ensured GuitarScene.setCamera is called only once after the board rotation / song countdown is complete, instead of every time in the render() during actual gameplay
++Added a new option category "Debug Settings" for all debug settings (such as HOPO debug, analog killswitch debug, in-game stats, unused text events, etc) so they don't confuse players
++Moved "P2 Menu Navigate" option from "Game Settings" to "Key Settings"
++Created a new 99pct1.ogg from the ending crowd cheers from Gugered's [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=5;t=31342]live Eagles - Hotel California song (from the Hell Freezes Over tour)[/url] (and add Gugered to credits)
++Added gamexprt1's improved RB1 [url=http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b252/gamexprt1/mult2.png]mult2.png[/url] from [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=30757&st=540#entry326235]this post[/url]
++Added [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?sharekey=e3c55d9fd5ad51cfab1eab3e9fa335ca9a3675f7013ea352]sherranjjj001's You Rock sound for the GH1, 2, and 80's themes[/url] as the default / fallback rocksound.ogg
++Added .liquid.'s RB2-style [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?w5lkf4ghyoq]partial grey star files V2[/url] to the Rock Band 1 theme
++Added >Slash666<'s [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=11;t=31067]gameresults, pause, and editor GFX[/url]
++Added MeteOritO's RB hitflames [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=30757&st=410#entry322361]here in post #420[/url] - [url=http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?qrzh0z0ehwm]download[/url]
++Used Spikehead's guitscw2.ogg with removed leading silence from [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=30757&st=140#entry317733]this post[/url]
++Edited clapsound.ogg: normalized to -16db by perceived loudness, cut beginning so clap SFX starts right away, cut silent ending, ensured both waveform endpoints at center
++Fixed pause layering during song countdown
++Ensured the accuracy indicator from the last note hit is not still displayed after a restart
++Ensured that just letting an entire guitar solo go by without attempting to hit any notes does not result in a 100% perfect solo
++Moved spinning star rotation angle calculation / update from Guitar render() function to run() function
++Added logic to catch when a drum chord (which counts individual notes for streak) skips a "note streak" threshold (like, from 99 to 101) and display the appropriate streak notification
++Added logic to flash the overdrive strings just before You Rock for Rock Band based themes
++Recompiled library.zip and FretsOnFire.exe from sources

--------------------------
Changelog from 2.995 to 3.000:
[b]IMPORTANT differences between 2.9xx and 3.0xx that MUST be followed:
=====Filenames and folders are, for the most part, all lowercase now.  We needed a common naming convention, it was chaos before with capital letters tossed in wherever.
=======(These files do not change case: FretsOnFire.exe, MSVCR71.dll, doc\*.*, SDL.dll, SDL_image.dll, SDL_mixer.dll, SDL_ttf.dll, _GL__init__.pyd, and _GLU__init__.pyd)
=======Theme foldernames and song foldernames and neck filenames and stage filenames don't have to be lowercase (but .png extensions do, as always).
=====Renamed "crunchX.wav" to "selectX.wav" for clarity (these 3 SFX are randomly played as you change the highlighted item in a menu)
=====Renamed all Guitar screw up sounds from fibaX.wav to guitscwX.wav
=====Renamed all Bass screw up sounds from bfibaX.wav to bassscwX.wav
=====All .wav files have been compressed to .ogg files.  We needed a common sound file format, and this reduces space taken (they all load into memory at startup anyway).
[/b]
--------------------------
==Replaced RbMFH theme's editor.png with >Slash666<'s fixed image
==Replaced RbMFH theme's Preview.png with BlackJack's fixed image
++Added Blazingamer's font shadowing to songlist (only applies to GH2 & GH3 themes, RB themes unaffected)
++Added Blazingamer's font shadowing to gameplay (this also results in the Rock Band theme using the songlist font in-game, looks OK so I'm gonna leave it)
++++New option under "Fretboard Settings" -> "In-Game Font Shadow" (default Off) - will double-render text objects during gameplay for a shadowing effect (Off to minimize lag)
++Added "mfhlogo.png" to credits and data\ folder
++Added blank lines to end of credits so they scroll off the screen before the credit sequence ends
++Added version numbers to Python and Pygame entries in credits since I know them
++Partial translation code changes from evilynux's [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=24664&st=4970#entry311217].diff patch[/url] (any of the bool or int options can have translated dictionary values; the game never refers to those strings, only to the bool or int -- so most of these changes are unnecessary)
++Prevented Neck_0.png from being included in the new neck randomization logic
++Updated to V2 of Figure's Fakir font for Rock Band theme from [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=11;t=25341]this post[/url]
++Added new logic (for Rock Band scoring style only) to calculate and use mrhoievo's partial grey stars from [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=24664&st=4860#entry309884]this post[/url] -- [url=http://i36.tinypic.com/ka1r41.jpg]SS[/url]
++Added support for separate / optional "drum_overdrive_side_bars.png" - if not present it won't be used

++Added translatable string "% Complete" from [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=11;t=24664;st=5030#entry312617]BlackJack's post[/url]
++Added separate setting to allow in-game star scoring without the text stats - [url=http://i36.tinypic.com/2mop76g.jpg]SS with partial grey star[/url]
++++"In-Game Stats" setting now only controls the display of Average Multiplier and Total Accuracy - default now Off
++++New option, under "Theme Settings" -> "In-Game Stars": (default "RB Only") "Off", "RB Only", "On"
++++New option, under "Theme Settings" -> "Partial Stars": (default "Auto") "Auto", "Off"   (enables Partial Grey Star system, if available)
++Added log entry to startup routine that displays internal pygame version
++Ensured lyric font does not get shadowed (shadowed lyrics are quite jumpy)
++Added Blazingamer's new GH3-style 3D keys with hit and hold models to both Guitar and Drum objects (no hold models for Drum objects, of course) - 3D notes and keys currently display white
++Relocated script / static lyric display determination logic to initialization routine, so it doesn't happen repeatedly during render
++Fixed loading screen's incorrect font size estimation (was always off-center)
++Added logic to recognize current method of sorting tier songs by name (1. 2. 3.) and filter these numbers out of the songlist display 
++Added logic to add indents to tier songs (when sorting by tier)
++Added evilynux's [url=http://rafb.net/p/M1LU7n80.html].diff patch[/url] to skip blank songlist / cd list lines, and to skip tier lines in songlist mode
++Added logic to catch entering of a completely empty song folder - and kick back out to the parent folder
++Added logic to remove any double blank lines in songlist (resulting from having no "bonus" songs while in career mode, for example)
++Added logic to allow Left and Right to stop on the CareerResetter as well as the Tiers
++Updated Left and Right songlist behavior to not get confused with evilynux's blank line & tier line skipper code
++++Rewrote Dialogs.wrapCenteredText() function to truly provide a line-by-line centering / wrapping capability (x parameter = centerline)
++Fixed GH3 loading screen to always wrap text around the right area (single-line phrases were not positioned correctly)
++Ensured lyric sheet doesn't show up on a song with lyrics when they are disabled
++Added support for Figure's [url=http://i199.photobucket.com/albums/aa248/Figure_02/Rock%20Band%20Stuff/overdriveready.png]overdrive_string_flash.png[/url] for Rock Band themes (glowing strings for a second or so whenever overdrive is gained or activated) - for Guitar objects
++Added support for a drum_overdrive_string_flash.png (does not yet exist) - for Drum objects
++Added missing fallback logic to Guitar objects for optional loading of overdrive side_bars and overdrive center_lines
++New user setting under Game Settings -> "MIDI/RB Sections" (default Auto): "Off", "Auto" - enables scrolling section names across the top of the screen (where available) - Guitar solos will still work with this Off (with no warning)
++evilynux renamed all neck filenames to Neck_001,002,003, etc. so they display in order again (since arbitrary neck filenames may now be used)
++Normalized all Rock Band main menu songs (they were at VASTLY different volume levels)
++Ensured that bass drum notes are always rendered before other drum notes, so the bass drum notes don't obscure them - [url=http://i38.tinypic.com/w8x9jb.jpg]SS[/url]
++Fixed use of translated "Standard" animated stage option in guitarscene (changed to "Normal" as well for clarity) - [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=11;t=24664;st=4900#entry310261]detail post[/url]
++When hit accuracy is set to display in the center and guitar solo is also set to display in the center, bump solo accuracy and review texts up above it to avoid overlap - [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=24664&st=4550#entry305541]detail post[/url]
++New option under "Audio Settings" -> "Mute last second" (default Off): Off, On (will mute all audio tracks at the last second for those who have songs with clicks at the end) -- [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=24664&st=4970#entry311323]detail post[/url]

++++Completely filtered out .PNG files now, with log warnings.  If every single stage is .PNG, this situation is now caught and blank stage mode is forced instead of a crash

++New logic inserts blank lines after each career tier, an "End of Career" marker sandwiched by blank lines after the last career song (shows where "bonus" songs start), and a blank line before "Reset Career"

++New option under "Fretboard Settings" -> "HOPO Indicator" (default Off) - shows "HOPO" at lower right-hand corner, greyed out = strums required, white = no strums required [url=http://i33.tinypic.com/30t6wzp.jpg]SS[/url]

++Updated to Alexfighter's v1.2f Spanish translation file
++Updated to BlackJack's v0.74 French (Reform 1990) translation file
++Updated to x-driver's v0.39 German translation file

++++Further enhanced HOPO Debug log entries to assist in location of reported HOPO bugs (added "Time left=" to end of each debug entry to provide an easy method to match log entries with video positions)
++Fixed 3D drum note mode (using Blazingamer's code from [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=24664&st=4600#entry306441]this post[/url])

++Line 698, Song.py - made "Reset Career" translatable
++Added logic to search for missed notes before any notes have been played (first note of song will mute now - they won't turn grey but at least they'll mute now)
++Enforced a minimum allowed sustain release window, tighter hitwindows result in a negative sustain release window -- [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=11;t=24664;st=4620#entry306684]detail post[/url]
++The "Theme Settings" -> "In-Game Stats" user option now completely disables all in-game star scoring / accuracy display / etc - and also disables the extra calculations during gameplay
++Changed RbMFH theme's Loading font to Fakir Regular TTF provided by acrox999 in [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=24664&st=4560#entry306015]this post[/url] (and created by Figure)

[i]New since 2.981:[/i]
++Added Blazingamer's tail render order fix, and updated 3D note rendering logic
++Updated in-game credits
++Duplicated MainText.png from GH2 theme to GH1 theme to add patch support for menu
++RbMFH overdriveneck.png now smaller and more transparent (please speak up if this is your neck, I'm not sure who made it)
++RbMFH theme now using kawaii's overdrive bar & glow from [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=24664&st=3720#entry294435]this post[/url]
++Added neck fallback logic to "defaultneck.png" if chosen neck invalid and "Neck_1.png" not found 
++Added [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=11;t=24664;st=4310#entry302471]death_au's RB mult.png, multB.png, and bassgroovemult.png[/url] to the RbMFH theme
++Added logic to catch strums without frets held and ignore them (used to act like overstrum)
++++Added user option to enable / disable this logic: "Fretboard Options" -> "Ignore open strums" ("Yes" = default)
++Added fablaculp's 2.981.2 French translation file and support code
++Added BlackJack's French (Reform 1990) translation file (v0.51)
++Added Alexfigher's 2.980+ Spanish translation file (v1.1b)
++Added TypusMensch's updated German translation file

++Added logic to precalculate static background and lyric sheet scale factors instead of recalculating every frame (should help lag)
++Rewrote a more efficient algorithm to determine note streaks of 100 and up (for displaying "xxx Note Streak!!", should help lag)
++Added logic to catch and filter out all unnecessary neckspeed re-calculations (only during actual BPM changes now; should help lag)
++Removed several unnecessary layers of VBPM logic; now only one algorithm controls VBPM & neckspeed instead of three fighting for control (should help lag)
++Added translation fix for "fretted by" string (newline now included in translation call)
++Added user option under "Fretboard Options" -> "Static strings" (default On) (should help lag when on)
++Prevented starpower from raising above 100% from killswitch action
++Added initialization for Dialogs.py: SongChooser's render() function's local variables notesTotal, notesHit, and noteStreak to prevent "undefined" crashes
++Added black background layer behind background of FileChooser ("Song List Settings -> Select Song Library", for example) to hide the "Options" background still being rendered underneath
++Added precalculated full-screen scale constants to stage rotation array instead of calculating on the fly (should help lag)
++Added user option to "MFH-Alarian Mod V2.9xx" -> "Whammy saves SP" (default No) -- to enable/disable slowdown of starpower / overdrive depletion rate with killswitch
++Fixed logic to apply the "miss volume" when releasing a sustained note early:
++++Ensured killswitch volume logic doesn't even get attempted unless there are currently "playedNotes" (should help lag)

[i]New since 2.980:[/i]
++Fixed the note tail problem (tails always "missed"):
++++Undid fix from 2.980 that reversed note render order (for guitar only), this requires much more attention to successfully fix
++++++Note that drum notes are still rendered in reverse order, since there are no sustains this doesn't matter to drum parts
++++Relocated sustain detection logic to the Guitar.run() function (instead of juggling back and forth between render functions)

[i]New since 2.963:[/i]
[i]Please note - the majority of these items were taken care of by EVILYNUX and BLAZINGAMER![/i]
+ If tutorial doesn't exist, display message and return to training menu instead of crashing
+ Fixed bug in font rendering routine
++ Scaling was applied twice when calling getSizeFont
++ Scaling now quasi-linear (as expected)
+ Improved font rendering a great deal
++ Smallest font source is now 30 instead of 15
+ Added support for a Song.ttf for the song info during the song start countdown, falls back on Menu.ttf for themes which do not have this font
+ Fixed Quickplay mode default song comment, was Career comment "play to advance"
+ Fixed song comment for practice mode, now shows "practice"
+ Improved stage loading logic and added log entries
++ Fallback to no background when none can be found
++ Fixed crash when stages folder exists but only contains practice.png
+Neck rotates and zooms in instead of just appearing when a song starts, during the countdown
+ Added songlist Score color to theme.ini (songlist_score_color)
+ Added practice to Career Mode pause menu
+ Added display of the longest note streak in parentheses, in the songlist
+ Added ability to have the paper in the song list screen scroll.
++ If you run out of the background, make sure you have a SongChooseBack.png just in case.
++ You turn the function on by putting songback = True in the theme.ini for that theme
+ Changed phrases to look more like the real games
+ New bass drum sound (the original was off-sync by a few ms)
+ Repositioned the GH3 POV (the current one was too low.
+ You can now turn off the the file path text in the song choose screen, from the Song List Options
+Versiontag can now be forced through the theme.ini
++This can be useful if you're using the versiontag.png as a top layer for the main menu
++You can turn this on by setting versiontag = true in the theme.ini
+ Added cmdline options
++ mode to select 1 player or 2 player mode
++ nbrplayers to specify the number of players
+ Added Credits to Options menu
++ Used credits mentioned in second post of his very thread

+open note color can now be defined with opencolor = (#hex) in the theme.ini
+score and note streak in songchooser no longer have an outline.

+Hit windows in drums have been fixed
+ CD List now uses songlist_extra_stats too (more intuitive)
+ Note streak between parentheses in CD List lie elsewhere
+Code has been cleared of all code that was commented out
+ Fixed more text to be translatable (thanks to Alexfighter and Fablaculp)
+ Added kawaii's bassgroovemult.png and mult.png for the 8bit theme (switched the color of the x2 and x3 of mult.png, so as to be consistent with the dots)
+ Repositioned the solo percent position for Rock Band.
+ Can use new drumfrets.png to render frets
++ This will draw separate bass drum fret buttons over normal frets
++ If drumfrets.png not present, it falls back to drumfretshacked.png, or alternately just fretbuttons.png as it worked previously
## Note: The other fret buttons still "light up" when a bass drum note is hit. I don't know how to fix this yet
+ Changed the way drumnotes.png works slightly
++ Image now has 6 rows rather than 5
++ Last two rows contain notes when star power is active
++ Modified images included for RbMFH, Gh3, Gh2, Gh1 and 8-bit themes
## Note: Keeping your old dumnotes.png will most likely result in distorted images for drums... Sorry for no backwards-compatibility there...
+Changed RbMFH theme DrumNotes.png to [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=24664&st=4230#entry301456]kawaii's[/url]

+ Display the name of the song on the highscore board (finished song)
+ Fixed crash in Key Settings Tester when Analog Killswitch is enabled and no joystick is connected
+Moved Rock Band theme "Bass Groove" text up higher when Jurgen is playing so the text doesn't overlap

++GuitarScene.py: line 3276, adding the blank missing in "fretted by", it should be " fretted by" to be displayed ingame correctly
++Dialogs.py: Lines 1536, 1538, 1534, and 1545 (using 2.979+font_smallfix), changed "scale = scale * 2.8" at the end of the lines to "scale = scale * 1.8"
==Renamed Theme Settings -> "RB Mult FX" setting to "RB Mult Grow" for clarity
++Changed loading screen rightMargin TO 0.65 for GH3 themes
++Dialogs.py, NeckChooser: moved the check for "NeckImage is None" to the "else"
+You can now have 3d star power notes
++Added [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=11;t=16498]Blazingamer's note.dae, star.dae, open.dae GH-themed 3D note files[/url] to GH3 theme folder and data folder so those who want to experiment with 3D notes can do so
++enable 3D notes with theme.ini entry: twoDnote = false 
++If there is no star.dae in your theme's folder it will use the star.dae in the data folder
++If there is no star.dae in your data folder it will use the note.dae in your theme's folder
++If there is no note.dae in your theme's folder it will use the note.dae in your data folder
+star.dae now rotates!!
++Rotates by default
++Can turn off rotation by adding threeDspin = False to the theme's theme.ini
+3d drum open note:
++Uses open.dae if one exists in the theme's folder
++If one doesn't exist it will just place a regular note in the middle
++Updated latest theme.ini and other GH3 files (that are currently included in official patches) from worldrave's GH3 hotfix3
+Reversed note rendering order, so that overlapping notes will appear correctly -- [url=http://img291.imageshack.us/my.php?image=coveriv5.jpg]problem screenshot[/url] -- [url=http://i35.tinypic.com/izlz43.jpg]Fixed screenshot[/url]
+Added user option under "Fretboard Options" -> "Frets under notes" for notes to pass over or under the frets (On by default) -- [url=http://i35.tinypic.com/2rzazwl.jpg]SS[/url]
+Fixed drum navigation when entering a highscore name (currently requires an Enter - green pad doesn't accept)
+Added new option to "Key Settings" -> "Drum highscore nav":
+++"On" allows the green drum pad to accept your highscore name
+++"Off" disables this (for those who play drums on the keyboard, this allows that letter to be used to enter a highscore name)
+Fixed fallback logic to allow main menus without any background music without a crash [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=11;t=24664;st=3930#entry298100]detail post[/url]

<em>New since 2.962:</em><br />
++Fixed "list index out of range" error caused by not selecting songs folder from options menu first time run (caused by iteration over self.items when it's empty)<br />
++Fixed default neck crash; if you've never selected Choose Neck, or have Random Neck selected from a previous version, Neck_1 will be forced.<br />
++Swapped Neck_1.png (default) with Neck_28.png (blank / transparent neck)<br />
++Fixed drum mode crashes (getrequirednotesMFH and other optimized functions needed to be added to drum.py)</p>

<em>IMPORTANT: Please "Choose Neck" before attempting gameplay with a fresh install / fretsonfire.ini to avoid a crash!  (This will be fixed next patch)</em><br />
<em>New since 2.960:</em><br />
++Added evilynux's code to force uppercase display for Career titles<br />
++Added evilynux's code to force uppercase display for Artists<br />
++Added bad animated background image / frame catching logic, will make log entry to point to problem file and display blank stage for bad frames<br />
++++UPPERCASE .PNG file extensions cause this problem!  While my code can now recognize and load these .PNGs, FoF's internal functions do not process these files correctly!  Renaming any .PNG to .png will fix this problem; if it does not, that particular image needs to be opened and re-saved in the correct png format (noninterlaced, optimized palette).<br />

++Completely relocated neck filename checks / neck counting to on-demand Neck Chooser menu (you will need to "Choose Neck" at least once after adding a new neck in order for "Random" to recognize the new count)<br />
++Changed "Yellow / Blue to change:" to "Yellow (#3) / Blue (#4) to change:" (for clarity in the neck selection menu)<br />

<em>New since 2.956:</em><br />
++Added Gh2 theme.ini entry to display songlist name text in black<br />
++Added user option for multiple Jurgen "play" logic styles (improving Jurgen gives me a test player to help isolate HOPO bugs while I observe):<br />
++++"Original" = Original style Jurgen play logic (from previous versions, 2.956 and below) - Jurgen has a lot of trouble with fast strums; may not recover in time and fail song<br />
++++"MFH-Early" = Optimized / rewritten Jurgen play logic - Jurgen can hit most fast strum patterns and CAN recover after missing some - still hits notes as early as possible<br />
++++"MFH-OnTime1" = Has logic to attempt to strum notes on time instead of as early as possible (by only showing Jurgen the notes that are on time or late)<br />
++++"MFH-OnTime2" = Also attempts to strum notes on-time, but this method exposes all notes in the hitwindow to Jurgen and he has to determine which to play (to emulate the behavior of a real player as much as possible, and to help flush out problems)<br />
+++Also added Jurgen "play" logic setting to pause settings menu<br />
++Optimized internal function call to retrieve the next note pattern to match (should help lag)<br />
++Optimized internal function call to retrieve missed notes outside the late margin (should help lag)<br />
++Enhanced optional Hopo Debug log output to include more helpful information on why each specific streak / multiplier reset occured<br />
++Added <a href="http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=24664&st=3420#entry289551">evil-doer's new Rock Band main menu</a><br />
++Added Blazingamer's animated killswitch tail fix (will not draw / animate tails past end of board; very long notes no longer cause excessive lag)<br />
++Fixed GH2 Strict HOPO problem as demonstrated by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPxWRbpYz10">Inkk's video</a>:<br />
++++Added logic to catch invalid pull-offs and ignore them (separately from invalid hammer-ons)<br />
++Disabled "early pick" logic (for strums before frets held down, if correct frets pressed quickly enough after strum) - was never working correctly anyway.  Should reduce lag.<br />
++Fixed complex tail loading logic<br />
++Added Blazingamer's fix for the theme.ini CD X position, which can now take on values from 0 to 5 to position the stack of CDs<br />
++Changed default for "Upload Scores" to "False" (causes delays, will be fixed when a starpower chart is up elsewhere)<br />
++Updated Gh3 theme patch files theme.ini, MainText.png, star3.png, star4.png from <a href="http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=11;t=28649">worldrave's Guitar Hero 3 theme</a> beta 3<br />
++Added support for EOF's "Test in FoF" function (as far as I can tell, it only directly tests Guitar Expert this way.)<br />
++Increased analog killswitch's starpower reward "chunk" size<br />
++Created a new HOPO system, "GH2" with no tag, that just forces a re-strum but does not break streak when tapping incorrect notes<br />
++Added logic to completely ignore manipulation of lower frets while a higher HOPO is held for GH2 and GH2 Strict systems (prepare however you'd like for your next pull-off!)<br />
++Rewrote & optimized the core HOPO strum / intention determination logic</p>

<br>---------===========-------------=============------------=============
<p><i>New in 2.900 since 2.830:</i>
<br>++Added <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?j3yg2gxq95j">Blazingamer's
neck select fix</a>
<br>++Added navigatable <a href="http://i28.tinypic.com/168wojn.jpg">new
song play choice dialog</a> before selecting instrument - "Play Mode:"
- "Gig",Practice"
<br>++Wrote logic to calculate generic practice sections for songs without
any markers
<br>++Added "Start" position to all practice section lists (for those that
want to practice the whole song single-track)
<br>++Added navigatable <a href="http://i28.tinypic.com/5loz11.jpg">new
generic song practice section choice dialog </a>(without actual section
names, for songs without them) before selecting instrument, if "Practice"
mode is selected.
<br>+++Rewrote new section retrieval and organization logic for the song
initialization to find practicable sections
<br>+++Wrote <a href="http://i31.tinypic.com/35kspkl.jpg">practice section
display</a> &amp; selection logic to replace generic song practice section
choices, when available
<br>+++Converted raw practice section locations to <a href="http://i30.tinypic.com/11uua8j.jpg">more
user-friendly mm:ss std time format</a>
<br>++Wrote logic to pass the necessary practice mode information between
files, classes, and functions used to prepare and play the song
<br>+++Wrote logic to take the practice information and use it to decide
which track(s) to load, and where to start playing them from
<br>++Wrote logic to disable failing when in practice mode
<br>++Practice mode will now start you 4 measures before the section you
picked
<br>++Wrote logic to prevent practice mode scores from being stored / uploaded
<br>++Created separate song-listing quick MIDI reader function to speed
up song listing (so it doesn't have to retrieve practice sections in the
song list)
<br>++Added support for all GH1-style simple text event markers to be practice
sections (messy but effective)
<br>++If only one text event / practice marker, the automatically-generated
section splits will be used instead
<br>--------------------------------
<br><i>If you want to practice a multi-track song with all instruments
playing...</i>
<br><i>make a copy of that song's folder, edit the title in the song.ini
so you</i>
<br><i>can tell the difference, merge all the .ogg tracks into the song.ogg,
and</i>
<br><i>delete all .ogg files except song.ogg.</i>
<p><i>To add practice sections to a song with NO text / section events
at all (no solo markers),</i>
<br><i>just add text events or section markers wherever you'd like a practice
marker. (GH1-style)</i>
<p><i>If you would like to add practice sections to a song that already
has guitar solo markings,</i>
<br><i>and those solo markings are actual section markers (like in Rock
Band), you must add</i>
<br><i>more section markers to designate practice sections.</i>

New in 2.8:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
================================2.830:
[url=http://www.mediafire.com/?gtm44gvcmkm]Download old patch[/url] [i]New in 2.830 (from 2.825):[/i]
[url=http://ifile.it/rjvi9tx]ifile.it alternative 2.830 patch download host[/url]
++Added [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=24664&st=600#entry245814]wolferacing's gold star results mod for Rock Band themes[/url]
++Changed default theme background color to black
++Fixed starperfect.png reference with incorrect case (caused Linux issues; file "starperfect.png" was NOT renamed)
++Applied gold star display mod to Rock Band songlist as well
--Changed sustained note scoring back to old FoF to avoid high score problems
+++Increased requirement for Rock Band guitar gold stars from 5.00x to 5.30x to compensate for FoF's higher sustain scoring
+++Increased requirement for Rock Band bass and rhythm guitar parts from 4.65x to 4.80x to compensate for FoF's higher sustain scoring
+++Created separate logic for Drum parts to maintain the 4.65x requirement for gold stars
++Added GH1-style (non-section) solo off marker "gtr_off" - fixes GH1 solos until end such as Cowboys From Hell and Bark at the Moon
++When Jurgen is playing, moved Guitar Solo "Rock Band" accuracy and review displays to above "Jurgen Is Here"
++Added blank "artist" property to folder items so searching by artist name no longer causes an error with subfolders present



================================2.825:
[url=http://www.mediafire.com/?mjvedwqmkde]Download old patch[/url] [i]New in 2.825 (from 2.821):[/i]
++Added logic to catch when an old fretsonfire.ini points to an invalid theme folder and force the default theme instead of crashing
++Adapted and added Blazingamer's features:
+++New POV setting "Theme" will display the appropriate POV for your selected theme type (GH2, GH3, or RB)
+++Now optional basic main menu positioning is available with a custom theme.ini file in a custom theme (explained in doc\ThemeINI Instructions.txt)
+++Basic theme.ini settings can now be theme-specific (base_color, selected_color, etc)
+++Fixed default text color (was set to yellow, now is back to white)
++Only using score font for guitar solo reviews in Rock Band themes; otherwise normal font will be used (GH3 score font does not include all characters)
++Only using score font for guitar solo accuracies in Rock Band themes; otherwise normal font will be used (GH3 score font does not include all characters)
++Added valid solo section markers for Foreplay / Long Time ("Guitar Lead") and Pleasure ("Guitar Ostinato") 
++Changed options for "Killsw Debug" to "Off" and "On" (used to be Off and P1, now works for both players)
++Adjusted new GH2 theme score text position to more closely match the new rockmeter
====However, the rockmeter's digit separator spacing is less than the font's spacing between digits, so large scores overlap the lines


================================2.821:
[url=http://www.mediafire.com/?y21faltmc1z]Download old patch[/url] [i]New in 2.821 (from 2.820):[/i]
++Rewrote theme folder detection and default theme determination:
++++Theme folders with an extension (like "RbMFH.old") are now recognized as valid
++++Theme folders without a Notes.png file are not even added to the potential theme list
++++If the default theme (RbMFH) does not exist, it will default to the first VALID theme folder found
--Bass groove multiplier images for all themes are now in a [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?oijknjnbs91]separate file[/url]


================================2.820:
[url=http://www.mediafire.com/?yn0dxpowmcz]Download old patch[/url] [i]New in 2.820 (from 2.816):[/i]
++Added crash-catching logic for case when analog whammy is set but joystick is not present
++Added [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=24664&st=470#entry244351]death_au's graphical bass groove multiplier[/url]
++Added [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=11;t=24664;st=510#entry244797]wolferacing's solo accuracy "Rock Band" position[/url] up above fretboard
+++Moved this accuracy text slightly upward so that it can be clearly seen even when Jurgen is playing
+++Also moved the solo review text to the same vertical offset
++Changed Guitar Solo accuracy display font to score font
++Changed Guitar Solo accuracy display color to white
++Changed default Guitar Solo accuracy display position to Rock Band
++Changed Guitar Solo solo review font to score font
++Reordered solo review text, added center-based text wrapping logic
++Added 2 player simultaneous solo review support (before, only the most recent guitar solo review would be displayed no matter which player)
++Added new analog killswitch mode: "XBOX" mode is for XBOX guitar controllers, "PS2" is for PS2 guitar controllers, and "Off" = digital killswitch
+++Added separate analog killswitch mode settings for P1 and P2 so two different types of guitar controller can be used together
++Moved analog whammy killswitch P1/P2 settings to Key Settings menu
++Ensured if a note is missed / streak is reset that the Guitar Solo isn't counted as a Perfect Solo (forced to 99%)
++Added new options for Rock-Band specific feature Bass Groove (all other MIDI event-based features can already be configured this way)
+++++"Off" feature off in all themes
+++++"RB" feature on in Rock Band themes only
+++++"On" feature on in all themes
===
[i]Patch 2.820 includes bassgroovemult.png image files for each theme.  If you don't have all themes installed, and you install all the bassgroovemult.png files, then the game might try to use the RbMFH default theme even though you don't have a full one installed.
The next patch will not include the theme files, they will be in a separate download.
SUMMARY:  if you do NOT have the RbMFH theme installed, then delete the Themes\RbMFH folder!  Also delete any other theme folders that are not complete...[/i]
===


================================2.816:
[url=http://www.mediafire.com/?lnid4ilyfmw]Download old patch[/url][i]New in 2.816 (from 2.815):[/i]
++Updated Blazingamer's GH2 Complete Rockmeter to the latest patch version and added
      [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?dxh1dxyjddc]Blazingamer's updated GH2 theme for v2.816+[/url]
++Added "synth" to list of solo section label filters (synth solo was incorrectly triggering a guitar solo)


================================2.815:
[url=http://www.mediafire.com/?dnnufhmmgwb]Download old patch[/url][i]New in 2.815 (from 2.812):[/i]
++Added .liquid.'s solo crowd responses (rocksound.ogg plays when solo start, and solo finish at 100%.. messy solo gets failsound.ogg)
++Changed neck select default back to ON for the noobs that can't find the setting to enable it
++Cut score for held notes in half to more closely match [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=11;t=24664;st=350#entry243268]GH3's sustain scoring[/url]
++Raised RB scoring gold star required average multiplier up to 5.00x for guitar parts, left at 4.65x for drum and bass parts
++Added new option under "Visual Settings" - "GtrSolo Pos" for guitar solo accuracy display position:
+++++"Right" (default) displays guitar solo accuracy to the right of the fretboard
+++++"Center" displays guitar solo accuracy centered on the fretboard (works best with 0 decimal places)
+++++"Left" displays guitar solo accuracy to the left of the fretboard


================================2.812:
[url=http://www.mediafire.com/?vymiw3dnrxv]Download old patch[/url][i]New in 2.812 (from 2.811):[/i]
++Fixed quite a few incorrect variable names in GH and FoF style star scoring



================================2.811:
[url=http://www.mediafire.com/?ymntm0vvjxg]Download old patch[/url][i]New in 2.811 (from 2.810):[/i]

================================2.810:
[url=http://www.mediafire.com/?mpmgudts2cg]Download old patch[/url][i]New in 2.810 (from 2.805):[/i]
++Added new option under "Visual Settings" - "Decimal Places":
++++You may now select the number of decimal places to display (0 - 2), used for the following numerical displays:
+++++++Overall accuracy, average multiplier, guitar solo accuracy, note hit timing, and now analog killswitch debug as well
++Added new scoring option to "Star Scoring" under Game Settings (version)
+++Modeled after [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=11;t=24664;st=220#entry242351]data gathered by italiansta1lion[/url]
++++"RB" (default) style scoring uses the following ranges to determine stars: 
(tweaked slightly to not be so much easier than GH scoring on lower stars, and so it wasn't so easy to get gold stars on many RB songs)
1 star: 0.25x average multiplier
2 star: 0.50x average multiplier
3 star: 1.00x average multiplier
4 star: 2.00x average multiplier
5 star: 3.00x average multiplier
Gold:   4.65x average multiplier
++Further refined HOPO strum intention logic to properly handle picking before-and-after-chord HOPOs (try In Bloom now)
++Added optional log debug output on streak resets if HOPO Debug is enabled
++Added support for a second type of Rock Band solo, as in REM - Orange Crush:  "[section gtr_line]" can begin a Guitar Solo
++Added "fade" logic to the analog killswitch... 
++++whammy position is the volume target and it changes in small steps towards the target...
++Moved Killswitch / whammy debug display down slightly to not interfere with gutiar solo accuracy


===============================2.805:
[url=http://www.mediafire.com/?mtmybwntbjw]Download old patch[/url][i] - New in 2.805 (from 2.801):[/i]
[url=http://www.megaupload.com/?d=ZOUEDYER]Download lsapg's 2.805 installer package[/url]: 10 necks, 10 GH3 stages, GH3 & RbMFH themes, ~76 MB, MegaUpload host
++Increased Guitar Solo section detection slop
++Added logic to double-check if the player reset streak at any time during a solo (backup Perfect Solo detection)
++Added logic to ignore GH-style solo markers once a Section marker has been found (the two styles interfere and are mixed in GH2 songs)
++Added "[" open bracket to GH-style solo marker filter (gets mixed up with other GH2 text events)
++Added logic to catch Guitar Solos that last until the very end of the song (GH2 - Search and Destroy)
++Added user option for Guitar Solo accuracy display:
++++"Off" will not display your Guitar Solo accuracy as you play, just the review when you finish a solo
++++"Percent" (default) will display your Guitar Solo accuracy as a percentage only
++++"Detail" will display your Guitar Solo accuracy as a percentage and show you notes hit / total notes
++Centered Guitar Solo results text, and shortened display time
---Removed repeated Guitar Solo results in scaling text
++Added required logic to display Player 2's solo review in the correct viewport
++Added logic to prevent total accuracy display when paused or failed (unless HOPO Debug option is on, because I find it useful when debugging)
++Added logic to prevent Guitar Solo accuracy or review information from displaying when paused or failed
++Added logic to prevent Killswitch Debug from displaying when paused or failed
++Added some missing image object cleanup after each song (probably part of memory leak)
++Added support for in-game star scoring system & SFX in GH themes:
++++This requires ghthemename\Sounds\starding.wav and of course the starwhite stargrey starperfect imagefiles
++Added logic for separate overall accuracy and average multiplier display location in GH theme (on top of stars)

[url=http://www.megaupload.com/?d=DQNXUYQ8]Download lsapg's 2.801 Full Version installer package[/url]: all 5 themes, ~150 MB, MegaUpload host
++Fixed guitar solo restart bug
++Changed a couple of the default setting selections to provide a much quicker-loading / better-performing game with a blank fretsonfire.ini file and no settings changes:
+++++Rock Band themes overdrive neck glow defaults to OFF
+++++Library count, rotation, and neck selection all default to OFF initially
+++++The default theme, if none is selected, will be "RbMFH" instead of "Gh3" since I consider it to be the main theme of this mod
+++++Stage rotation defaults to OFF now to shorten default song loading time
+++++Guitar Solo neck style defaults to Overlay
+++++Players defaults to 2 (since you can easily enable / disable player 2 when selecting song difficulty and part)
+++++Point Of View defaults to Rock Band instead of FoF
+++++Fullscreen now defaults to OFF
+++++Large Drum Neck defaults to OFF
++Rearranged "Key Settings" menu to be more convenient

============================================================================================================2.800:
[i]New features since [URL=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=3440#entry237784]Alarian mod v2.7.hotfix25[/URL]:[/i]
++Added "organ" to the solo section filter list so it won't trigger the Guitar Solo neck.
++Added user option for Guitar Solo neck mode under "Fretboard Settings":
++++"Off" will not show any neck changes for Guitar Solos
++++"Replace" (default) will replace neck with "guitarsoloneck.png" - Overdrive neck will replace this neck.
++++"Overlay" will create a static neck overlay with "guitarsoloneckovr.png" - this will show on top of overdrive
++Fixed after-chord HOPO marking / playing issue
++Added "play" to list of words to not allow with "solo" to detect a Guitar Solo section
++Added Rock Band-like real-time in-game 5-star scoring display (if starwhite.png and stargrey.png are found)
+++Added numerical total accuracy display
++Added starperfect.png support to display 100% in-game
+++Used Death Au's white / grey star images
+++Used Daevid's gold star image
+++Used anthman's perfectly ripped Rock Band star "ding" sound from gameplay
++Relocated a large portion of the in-game text and lyric event string manipulation to song preprocessing / loading
++Added Rock Band-like solo note counting, review, and bonus score:
++++Perfect Solo: 100%, 100n points
++++Awesome Solo: 95%-99%, 50n points 
++++Great Solo: 90% - 94%, 30n points
++++Good Solo: 80% - 89%, 20n points
++++Solid Solo: 70% - 79%, 10n points
++++Okay Solo: 60% - 69%, 5n points
++++Messy Solo: 0% - 59%, 0 points 
++Added numerical average multiplier display
++Fixed average multiplier calculations during gameplay and afterwards (at results):
----Before, one could get above 4x average multiplier in a song with chords without using starpower.
++++Now, the only way to get above a 4x average multiplier (besides long notes) is to use starpower and get above 4x long enough
++Added Blazingamer's option for the vertical POV, like in ddr and rock revolution (under "Fretboard Settings" - "POV" - "Rock Rev")
++Added new option under "Game Options" - "In Game Stats":
++++"Off" will not display average multiplier and overall note hit accuracy during gameplay
++++"RB" (default) will only display average multiplier and overall note hit accuracy during gameplay in Rock Band themes
++++"On" will always display average multiplier and overall note hit accuracy during gameplay
++Fixing Guitar Solo accuracy note counting with some slop logic - was including / missing notes just at the edge of the solo events
+++Added some solo marker timing slop to allow for late activation of Guitar Solo events (game lag)
+++Will also ensure a maximum of 100% guitar solo accuracy
++Added logic to not go to score results screen if Jurgen is playing solo and finishes the song
+++Or, if Jurgen is playing both players, it will also bypass the score screen
++Fixed many 2-player issues
+++Duplicated many of the newer features to be compatible with two players

++++Each player has their own in-game star score 
++++Each player has a total note hit accuracy and average multiplier display
++++Each player has an early/late hit accuracy display

Hotfix #25 - [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?ytmm9htcndk]Hotfix Link[/URL] -- [URL=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=3440#entry237784]Post[/URL]
++Updated logic to allow the very first note in a song to start a HOPO (had become outdated with new HOPO system)
++Fixed [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=2890#entry232178]fail before countdown complete bug[/url]:
++++You may now fail during the song start countdown (should you be that ambitious), and the fail screen will now prevent the song from playing
++Added option to "Rotate Stages" - "BackNForth" 
++++This mode will display stages in order from first to last, and then from last to first, and repeat.

Hotfix #24 -- [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?gwdz0ijnm3c]Hotfix Link[/URL] -- [URL=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=3430#entry237579]Post[/URL]
++Gave Jurgen the ability to hammer-on and pull-off, and updated his algorithm to the latest GH2 requirements.
+++Jurgen will now officially kick your ass with any instrument (unless you can tie his 100%)
++Refined HOPO strum intention logic - seems really solid now
--Removed killswitch debug display when playing Drums
++Added some color coding to better bring out the killswitch debug display:
+++++When an analog killswitch is in use, and the value is 0.0, it will be grey.  Otherwise it will be yellow.
+++++When a digital killswitch is in use, and it is off, it will be grey.  If it is on, it will be yellow.
++Moved unused MIDI text events, if they are enabled, to scroll across the screen a bit lower than the section names
++When the lyricsheet.png is drawn, the song title and info are repositioned (the title should appear in the lyric bar)
++When the lyricsheet.png is drawn, the song play coundown time left display is slightly moved to better accomodate the unused text event scrolling

Hotfix #23 - [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?1mnswwmmeej]Hotfix Link[/URL] -- [URL=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=3420#entry237383]Post[/URL]
++Fixed occasional crash caused by hotfix 22's new logic (global variable 'num' no longer should be a problem)
--Removed previous hotfix's HOPO intention determination logic unnecessary debug code:
----Removed fretsonfire.log file entry each time a "miss" was detected
----Removed "Flag: False/True" in-game debug display for the flag used to activate the new HOPO logic
++Converted and added [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=3410#entry237210]oesick's redone lyricsheet.png[/url]

===[i]I accidentally left an on-screen debug for the new HOPO logic.. the "Flag:" display shows when this problematic situation has been detected and the game is watching for a possible correction.[/i]
+++Added option under "Key Settings" - "Key Conflicts":
+++++"No check" will not check for conflicting keys at all (WARNING: assign conflicting keys and you will have problems in-game)
+++++"Notify" will check for conflicting keys and warn you, but will not reset your new key (default)
+++++"Enforce" (old logic) will check for conflicting keys and prevent you from setting a conflicting key
++++This now allows you to set your keys the way you'd like.  The old mode made it difficult to set your keys, as you had to hunt for the conflicting key and change it to something else unused before you could assign it to the control you wanted.
+++Added "outro" to the solo section filter to prevent "outro solo" sections from triggering Guitar Solos.
++Rewrote after-chord HOPO marking logic to not allow chord pull-offs if the HOPO is the same as the top note in the chord.
++Rewrote same-note HOPO strum logic checks to include a little more intelligence in how the game determines when to reject a strum:
+++When a string of the same note comes up, and the first is a HOPO, the game will keep track of your strums and attempt to determine your intentions
++++Instead of cutting the strum hit window in half when these HOPO-samenote sequences come up like before, now you should be able to strum these sections your way
++++If the user strums the first HOPO, and the game thinks the strum is for the next note - 
+++++++then if the user strums the note one more time at the end of the sequence, the game will realize that strum was meant for the last note and not apply a penalty.
++++If the user HOPOs the first note, and intends to strum the next note but the hitwindows overlap -
+++++++then if the user doesn't strum the last note in the sequence, the game will realize the first strum was meant for the note after it, and not apply a penalty.

Hotfix #21 - [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?n37jotbjxtz]Hotfix Link[/URL] -- [URL=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=3330#entry236553]Post[/URL]
++Added [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=3290#entry235788]wolferacing's RB beta gfx & switch[/url] with some fallback logic to prevent crashes in RB themes without "beta" graphics files
++Added [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=3290#entry235783]worldrave's new GH3 menu BG[/url]

Hotfix #20 - [url=http://i31.tinypic.com/11qh375.jpg]Screenshot[/url] -- [URL=http://www.mediafire.com/?tj3e0eta1lf]Hotfix Link[/URL] -- [URL=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=3280#entry235715]Post[/URL]
++Altered lyrical pitch change event display from the actual "+" to "~"
++Increased relative speed of lyrics (decreased lyric retrieval window) so words appear further apart, prevents more overlapping
++Adjusted vertical position of lyrics to separate them better from the lyricsheet.png bottom line
++If lyrics are present in the song, show lyric sheet and rearrange score / streak displays / accuracy's upper right display position
++++Score and streak boxes and text positions now relative to lyrics sheet and top of screen
++++Accuracy display when set to upper right position is now low enough to not overlap the counters.
+++If lyrics are not present in a song, the lyricsheet graphic will not load and the Rock Band screen rearrangement will not occur.
+++If the lyricsheet graphic is not present in a theme, that theme will not be rearranged
++Updated glorandwarf's key conflict checker with trinidude's patches and reactivated to prevent assigning conflicting controls
++Added extra logic for bass pedal sound playing so that other drum keys don't accidentally get recognized as the bass drum
++++Please note, the random drum samples still contain a bass drum sound.  If you don't ever want the other drums to play a bass drum sound, find this file and replace it.
++Added fallback logic for when data\Sounds\bassdrum.wav is not present, so this does not cause a crash.

Hotfix #19 - [URL=http://www.mediafire.com/?sn1mnsengt0]Hotfix Link[/URL] -- [URL=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=3220#entry235051]Post[/URL]
++Added fallback logic if a nonexistant neck filename is selected; in this case, it will set neck 0 (random necks)
++Changed "Rock Band text events" option to "Rock Band events" with new settings:
+++++"Off" will not process any Rock Band / MIDI text events (lyrics, sections, solos, etc) or attempt to load a lyricsheet.png
+++++"On" will process all Rock Band / MIDI text events (lyrics, sections, solos, etc) and attempt to load a lyricsheet.png
+++++"RB Only" will process all Rock Band / MIDI text events (lyrics, sections, solos, etc) and attempt to load a lyricsheet.png -- only in Rock Band themes.

++Added very beta Rock Band MIDI lyric scrolling and timing / highlighting logic
++++Rock Band MIDI lyrics will scroll from right to left, a syllable at a time.
------Some syllables too close together currently overlap...
++Added support for optional "lyricsheet.png" in the theme folder:
++++This will display a Rock Band-ish lyric background graphic (originally provided by wolferacing) at the top of the screen.
+++++This also shows the timing line with a fake voice arrow 1/4 of the way across the screen.  Lyrics are centered around this timing line.
++++Lyrics just at the timing line are being sung right now (current lyric).  These will be colored green-blue.
++++Lyrics to the right of the line (future lyrics) are colored white
++++Lyrics to the left of the line (past lyrics) are colored grey
++++Long lyrics that change pitch at certain times have these pitch changes marked in the text with a "+" symbol
++++This symbol has been shifted up to the top of the screen to prevent unnecessary overlapping
+++Added user option under "Game Settings" - "MIDI/RB Lyrics":
++++"Off" will not display any MIDI / Rock Band lyric events
++++"Auto" will display scrolling MIDI / Rock Band lyric events
++Added check for the word "drum" before recognizing a "solo" text event as a Guitar Solo
++Added check for the word "map" before recognizing a "solo" text event as a Guitar Solo
++Applied scrolling and coloring logic to section labels, which will scroll on the top of the screen.

Hotfix #16 - [URL=http://www.mediafire.com/?ozwe1jzy3mf]Hotfix Link[/URL] -- [URL=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=3140#entry234518]Post[/URL]
++Added Guitar Hero 1 style solo markers (regular text events, NOT sections, "solo_on" and "solo_off") to the Guitar Solo recognition logic
+++Yes, Guitar Hero 1,2, and 3 songs should now have recognized Guitar Solo sections.
+++You may now designate a guitar solo section Rock Band style, with "section" markers 
+++++++example: "[section_gtr_solo_a]" begins, "[section_verse_a]" ends  (end marker can NOT have "solo" in it)
+++Or, you can use Guitar Hero 1 style simple text events
+++++++example: "solo_on" begins, "solo_off" ends
++Added support for section labels and solo markers with capital letters in them (all lowercase is no longer required)
++Added "bassdrum.wav" a bass drum sample sound, which will play whenever the bass drum is hit, note or not - [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=3050#entry233781]HolystoneH's sample[/url]
[i]+++This file is required for operation.  No fallthrough logic to stop crashes if it isn't there.[/i]
+++Added user option under "Audio Settings" - "Bass kick sound" to enable or disable this bass drum sound
++++"On" will play the bass drum sound whether there was a note there or not, whether you hit or missed.
++++"Off" will play normal random drum screwup sounds when the bass pedal is hit at the wrong time, and no additional sound will play when bass drum notes are hit.
++Reordered drum keys to match note numbers, which caused the following:
+++Jurgen now has drumming skills.

++Added logic needed to correctly process successive guitar solo sections (such as: section_gtr_solo_a, section_gtr_solo_b, section_chorus_a)
+++When a Guitar Solo section is started, and no Guitar Solo is already in progress, the "Guitar Solo!" text will show and scale
+++If a new Guitar Solo section comes up, the last section was also a Guitar Solo, the "Guitar Solo!" text sill not be shown again
+++When a Guitar Solo section ends (with a non-solo section), the text "Solo Finished!" will show and scale (this will eventually be your solo performance review)
++Ensured resources are freed after finishing a song (this was accidentally removed while debugging another problem in an earlier hotfix)fs

+++++When Guitar Solo ends, the neck will go back to normal.
+++++Starpower neck overrides Guitar Solo neck (only one will display)

++++++++[i]PLEASE NOTE the Bass Groove multiplier text will currently only show in Rock Band themes![/i]
++++++++[i]Bass players in GH themes will have "4x" still displayed incorrectly for now![/i]
++++Bass Guitar parts will have the capability to reach 5x and 6x multipliers for hit streaks of 40 and 50.
+++++These new multipliers also scale 2x with starpower / overdrive (Bass players can reach 10x and 12x multipliers)

++Added Wolferacing's drum graphics (drumcenterlines.png, DrumNotes.png) for 8bit, Gh1, Gh2, and Gh3 (lines corrected)

Hotfix #7 -- [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?4t1zw13mwad]Link[/url] - [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=2590#entry229537]Post[/url]
++Added new option under Key Settings > Drum Keys > Auto Drum SP (Auto Drum Starpower Activation)
+++Now you can choose to have the game automatically activate your starpower for you
+++Handy for those with drumsets that don't want to reach or search for the starpower button, or for the lazy (like me)

Hotfix #6 - [url=http://i26.tinypic.com/15f6he0.jpg]Screenshot[/url] -- [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?lbr3vdneqzq]Link[/url] - [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=2580#entry229522]Post[/url]
++Re-enumerated all player0/player1 guitar/drum keycodes to ensure no interference
+++Player 0's drum starpower will now no longer automatically activate whenever the red drum is hit.
+++Increased allowed thickness of bass drum note rendered from DrumNotes.png
+++Created 2 new Rock Band "rock meter" arrows, one for Bass and one for Drums
++++Three new files used with new rock meter arrow code: rockarr_guitar.png, rockarr_bass.png, rockarr_drums.png
++++If one of these images is not present, it will attempt to load the regular rock_arr.png as a fallback
++++New code has been written to represent your selected instrument on the Rock Band rock meter.
+++++This new code currently will only determine Player 0's part and use that rock meter arrow
+++++I still have to adapt this to 2 players so that each player can have a different rock meter arrow

Hotfix #5 - [url=http://i28.tinypic.com/2h6btqg.jpg]Screenshot GH3 (too many lines)[/url] -- [url=http://i28.tinypic.com/bi10cw.jpg]Screenshot RB[/url] -- [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?aamz4d4ysfw]Link[/url] - [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=2580#entry229490]Post[/url]
++++Added support for an optional drumcenterlines.png in a theme folder.
+++++If this file is not found, no drum center lines will be drawn
++++++Included Wolferacing's GH3 and RB drumcenterlines.png files -- RB looks good once again but GH3 has one too many strings still... see screenshots.

Hotfix #4 - [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?z4mrzm2bg3j]Link[/url] - [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=2570#entry229474]Post[/url]

+++++Created a set of 8 drum screw up sounds (data\Sounds\drumscw1.wav - drumscw8.wav) from random drum samples that Happ E Nose provided
++++Replaced Gh3 theme's DrumNotes.png with wolferacing's fixed file

Hotfix #3 - [url=http://i27.tinypic.com/dgs010.jpg]Screenshot GH3 (notes too close)[/url] -- [url=http://i25.tinypic.com/jb0l51.jpg]Screenshot RB[/url] -- [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?yzwi2lxz4mz]Link[/url] - [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=2560#entry229321]Post[/url]
++++Added capability for separate Drum Notes image files (use [url=http://i26.tinypic.com/2ahfl8o.jpg]this note format[/url] as a template for spacing and placement to make your own drum notes.)
+++++Included Wolferacing's GH3 and straight RB drum note files.
++++++The GH3 drum note image file's notes are too close together and need to be fixed (needs to be evenly spaced for the math to work!)
+++++++DO NOT USE THE INCLUDED Gh3\DrumNotes.png - they are included so that someone else might fix them.
+++++You may now add a "DrumNotes.png" file to any theme, in [url=http://i26.tinypic.com/2ahfl8o.jpg]this note format[/url], and the game will automatically detect and use it for drum tracks.
++++++If you do not have a "DrumNotes.png" file in a theme, the game will still automatically generate usable drum notes by hacking up Notes.png

Hotfix #2 - [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?vvtrk1gw1eh]Link[/url] - [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=2540#entry229116]Post[/url]

--------Myfingershurt takes over from here on up...
New in 2.62
+Actual GH3-tails in GH3-theme
+Actual Streak Lights in GH3-theme
+Hotfix #1-17 by [b]Myfingershurt[/b], QQStarS, Blazingamer -->http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=1900#entry223462
+Neckspeed is now always depending on Difficulty & BPM
+New Hitwindow calculation.
+New Hitflames (actual Blowtorch-graphics! in GH3-theme made by me :))
+Improved logics related to strumming, by Myfingershurt.
+2.6c hotfix #1 is included as well, with the nicely-trimmed 2 decimal point hit accuracies with the "ms" label.

New in 2.6:
+Spinning Starnotes in GH3-theme, with option to turn off in Visual Settings (This code was initially made by QQStarS. Spinning starnotes frames provided by Worldrave. Notesheet made by Alarian. Fixed QQStarS code so that the stars spin in the right direction and at the right speed)
+Made the hitwindows a little easier on all 3 settings
+Prevented the option to manipulate hitwindows in fretsonfire.ini
+New graphics in GH3-theme by Worldrave (fret-guide on backgrounds and high quality selection line in song list)
+New Overdrive neck again (Edited one neck provided by Ds~)
Hotfixes since 2.5c By Myfingershurt:
+Hotfix#7 - Fixed problem caused by hotfix 6, where certain chords after a tapped HOPO could not be strummed. Restructured the HOPO strum logic to accomodate the special checks necessary for the after-chord HOPO system.
+Hotfix#6 - Fixed case where a strummed chord pull-off before another chord would sometimes cause a streak reset.
+Hotfix#5 - Built on new logic from hotfix #4 and re-fixed the problem caused by the user pausing during the "You Rock" message.
+Hotfix#4 - Fixed issue where songs would not end (caused by the check for pause, new logic written).
+Hotfix#3 - Added new option to completely disable the Rock Band Starpower / Overdrive Neck Glow (under Fretboard options).
+Hotfix#2 - Fixed case where a chord pull-off before a long pause would result in that chord-pulloff requiring a strum. Fixed case where a chord pull-off too close to the end of a song would result in a funky half-HOPO half-chord merged strum. Fixed crash that happened when user pauses during "You Rock" message. Fixed problem where user managed to restart during "You Rock" message before the crash, and the game would try to restart and then immediately go to the results screen.
+Hotfix#1 - Ensured that special strummed HOPO logic does not get applied to tapped or pulled-off notes.  This has fixed speedpicked chord / pulloff / chord / pulloff / etc  issues. This is the so-called "Lefty Mode" fix.

New in 2.5c:
+Fixed Song list items overlapping info at bottom (Fixed the overlapping issue in RB theme that this caused in 2.5b )
+Fixed tight and wide note hit windows being swapped

+New RB Multiplier graphics (provided by Ds~)
+New Overdrive neck
+Themes fix by ShiekOdaSandz (first theme in themes folder wasn't selectable)

New in 2.36c:
+Quick fix to the Guitar Track unsync (that was in 2.36b)
+Note window is alot tighter on faster songs now since... (Less tight in 2.36c vs 2.36b)
+Note hitting margin are now based on Neckspeed instead of 100 BPM, this fixes some issues with overlapping hitmargins of notes. (vs Based on BPM in 2.36) which results in...
+vBPM fix by Glorandwarf (Finished in 2.36b vs unfinished in 2.36)
+Glorandwarf Fixed the issue with the notes hit number counting the chords as separate notes, while 
the streak number does not. This means that before, accuracy% was ALWAYS wrong if a song had chords in it. Same with notes hit/total
+Repositioned the Selected Neck image in GH3-theme slightly
+Added modified Gameresults screen (originally by Seraph_88), to match the Notes Hit / Total Notes 
info) and tweaked some positioning.
+Fixed the case sensitive issues with GH2-theme filenames
+12 Necks replaced by High Resolution necks (By Bluzer) these are Necks 11-22

+Added Notes hit / Total notes in Game Results, provided by Divra, ported and positioned by Lnkk

New in 2.3:
+Codescrubbing
+Codecleaning
+Menu Texts fixed - Before this, text looked different when you changed resolution.
+New Rockband Notes - Please note that the tails colors haven't been adapted to these notes!
+GH3 Gameresults background changed
+Stage backgrounds no longer need to be called "Stage1.png, Stage2.png" etc. All stages need to be put in <themefolder>\Stages\(Submitted by Glorandwarf)
+You Rock/Failed! messages are shown for a shorter time (perhaps too short ???)
+Daevid's GH1- and GH2-themes added.
+Custom themes feature - You can now have 11 themes called whatever you want, so there's 5 themes currently in the game so you can either add 1-6 more or replace the current ones... You get the picture. Just put them in the Themes folder, but make sure they follow the filename convention of the GH3-theme. This feature is still under development and there will be unlimited themes in the future with better customization-options.
+Scores are no longer uploaded with "RF-Mod" version-tag.


New in 2.0 Hotfix 1-28.5:

1) (thanks to khornerz for this solution) Multi-OS-friendly file-fetching code (Max / Linux / Win) 
2) 8-bit mod repaired
3) Guitar and bass track confusions fixed!
4) HO/PO system selection or diasble (fixed!)
5) Random stage backgrounds enable / disable setting
6) GH2 HOPO system no longer allows HOPO hits while holding a higher fret
7) GH2 "sloppy" HOPO system option added - allows tapping while holding a higher fret for sloppy players like myself
8) Fixed bugs related to "End Song" - which also will store partial song scores.  "Change Song" has been made the default option after scoring.  If a song is ended with 0 score, the results screen is bypassed - avoiding the looping bug that situation causes.  Also clarified "HOPO Timing" option names: "Close" "GH2" and "Far" - indicating the required spacing between notes for HOPOs to be possible
9) Fixed bug where "restart song" would render additional sets of BPM lines, showing up as ever-thickening BPM lines in-game and causing lag
9.5) (Blazingamer) - code cleanup, and CD-list background images have been fixed
10) Fixed bug "invalid literal for int" at score screen.  Also moved where the "loading" screen is displayed while preparing to play a song - it appears briefly and then disappears after some later code removes it again - at least it shows up now.  Also  reverted "HOPO Timing" setting labels to pre-Alarian values of "Less" "Normal" and "More"
11)   Full Release Automatic lyrics!  Settings available:
Lyrics Off
Lyrics only if song.ini says so
Lyrics On if script.txt available  auto mode
12) GH2 Strict / Sloppy system - Lefty mode fret / key enumeration fix - this affects how the game determines which frets are "higher" than others, and was screwed up by Lefty mode users in previous hotfixes.
13) CD label fix from Blazingamer 12.5
and updated to GH-like star scoring calculations from ShiekODaSandz as follows, and is based on average multiplier: THIS FIX IS BUGGED, GET 14
14) Fixed GH-like star scoring calculations where almost
FC'd songs give 4 stars -original solution by ShiekODaSandz- based on average multiplier:
5*=2.8x AND > 90% accuracy (this was the bugged part)
4*=2.0x
3*=1.2x
2*=0.4x
1*=0.0x
15) -solution provided by Alarian from across the pond-
Automatic main menu background scaling - 8bit mod main menu stretches to fullscreen now.
16) -Screenshot of new 8-bit background Stage2.png
"Random Stages" setting changed to "Stage Mode" setting, with options:
-Random  automatically selects a random stage1-stagexx.png
-Stage1  just uses Stage1.png
-Blank  uses BlankStage.png (REQUIRED NEW FILE)
ALSO - 8-bit mod supports random backgrounds, included are Stage1 original and Stage2 C64 forgot from who (REQUIRED AT LEAST STAGE1.PNG)
-Additional setup steps:-
-Place the BlankStage.png file in your data folder.
-Place the 8-bit Stage1 and Stage2.png files in the data\8bit folder.
17) (thanks to glorandwarf) Background randomization counting has been optimized.  Loading / preparation time to play a song has been reduced noticeably. 
18) GH2 Strict and GH2 Sloppy systems now ignore incorrectly-tapped frets between HOPO notes.  Also ensured that the special-case HOPO strum logic does not get applied to non-HOPO note checks. 
19) When holding a note with a lower fret, releasing the lower fret does not break the held note.  
20) (incorrect taps in between HOPOs ignored) is now only applied to the GH2 Sloppy system.    
21) Maze's Installer Capo's starpower clap SFX now available as an option.  HOPO System = "None" mode will now work with starpower and killswitch.    
22) Big GH2 HOPO sytem update!  HOPOs allowed after chords.  Chord pull-offs if you'd like.  All additional logic required to track the notes and mark them for this has been debugged.
Old HOPO system fix - sometimes, a note before a chord was just not tappable.  This will no longer happen.
Also - the Rock Band greyscale starpower notes have been redrawn by Maze, they are now glowing white.  These new notes are included in the hotfix, under data\Rockband Mod.
22.5)Interim update from Blazingamer: Hotfix 22.5:
Blazingamer has fixed some of the CD list display code.  If you already use Hotfix #22, just download this and add the Dialogs.py to your library.zip
23) CD List Bug Fixes:
-(Blazingamer22.5) CD / song rotation corrected
-(Blazingamer22.5) Auto song preview enabled
-(Blazingamer22.5) First CD shows label
However, hotfix 22.5 was not debugged... the yellow fret preview was not implemented, and no-CD list view was buggy.  Also, the CD cases for folders were still being rendered backwards.  So, from 22.5 I have:
-Added user setting for "Song Previews" - can be set to "Auto" or "Yellow Fret"
-Added yellow fret preview functionality again
-Added two additional CD case "select" rotations to properly face the front towards the user when browsing song library
Interim hotfix from glorandwarf: 23.5) Changed Code - Maze's Installer - Song "Loading" screen is now handled asynchronously from the actual song loading - so the "Loading" screen stays up until the song is ready to play now.
Test hotfix: 23.6) Added Glorandwarf's hotfix 23.5 code for asynchronous loading screen.  Also removed the one change from hotfix 17 to 18 that somehow might have caused GH2 Strict pull-off issues (please test, I cannot confirm).
24) GH2 Strict pull-off issues seem to have been fixed in test hotfix 23.6, so that change is included here. DO NOT GET 24, GET 24.1 INSTEAD.
The Divra starpower-friendly score chart has been added as the new default Starpower score upload chart.  Just enable "Upload Highscores" in the Game Settings.
(glorandwarf) The board speed during the song countdown now matches the song speed exactly.  A side effect of this is that the countdown's speed depends on the song's speed (slower songs will have a longer countdown).  
24.1) The Divra starpower-friendly score chart automatically-added address has been corrected (hotfix 24 used the viewing address as the upload address by mistake).  
25) Blazingamer's two new options for star scoring method (avg multiplier or raw percentage) and congratulations phrases (when you receive your star rating, the sound effects that play) have been implemented and debugged.  
26) Blessedmain's "You Rock!" graphic and EdisLeado's crowd cheer SFX played when you finish a song, before scoring.  Thanks to Alarian for the original code suggestion to achieve this.  Separate GFX for each theme - feel free to submit alternate images and sounds.  
Interim hotfix 26.5 from glorandwarf: The countdown length before a song will now be constant no matter the speed of the song.
27) Glorandwarf's countdown board speed timing fix #2 has been applied (all song countdowns will be the same now).
- Also, an option has been added that enables / disables HOPOs after chords (so everyone that has issues with it can disable it while I debug it, which may take a while) 
28) Full Release -GH2 Strict after-chord HOPOs have been fixed.  You may now remove fingers from a chord in order to tap a lower (or higher) note than was included in the chord without breaking your streak.  Also changed setting names:
"Starpower claps" is now "Starpower clap SFX"
"Congrat Phrases" is now "Score SFX"
Interim hotfix 28.5 from glorandwarf) Fixed player 2's default key settings, and player 2 key processing in solo mode.  Add to an installation that already has hotfix #28.

New in 2.0

+Blazingamer's CD/List added and tweaked both by him and me [b]mostly by him[/b] (Please tell me if this f*cks things up this time again, I've only tested it in GH3-theme...)
+Changed "Battle/Normal" to "Pro Face-Off / Face-Off" (just the texts)
+Fixed so you can have as many Stage*number*.png in your theme folder as you would prefer (except in 8-bit, didn't fix that one yet) So you can have just 1 or you can have 9999 (Sorry 10000 doesn't work) just name them Stage1.png, Stage2.png, Stage3.png etc etc and make them scaled 1.5:1 in imagesize (like 640x480 or 1024x768 etc)

+Tweaked positioning of part and difficulty choosing in GH3-theme so it doesn't get outside the square in the background. This was an quick and ugly fix because I moved the options panel in the options menu. A more thorough fix has to distinct between these two, now they are in the same function....
+Added ShiekOdaSandz fix to the stars in Setlist so they're not backwards ;)

New in 1.6

+COMPLETE 2-player mode (by QQStarS, BIG Kudos)

New in 1.1:
+Replaced the Svg-data system.
[i]Before, .svg-files were loaded and then checked if there was a .png-file to use instead. Now it just loads the .png directly if that's what you want to do and an .svg directly if that's what you want. This resulted in me stripping the game of over 100 trash .svg-files[/i]

+edited that ugly Optionspanel in GH3-theme
