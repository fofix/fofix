#summary These are all the Theme.ini settings usable.

First, you need to create a 'theme.ini' file in your theme's folder. Once you create the file you need to type this header at the very top of this file:

_{{{[theme]}}}_

Then use any of the following settings below the {{{[theme]}}} header in the theme.ini file. This list is mostly organized by which options belong mostly to which screen, but not necessarily to JUST that screen, since some items currently control things on multiple screens.
