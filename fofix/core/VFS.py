'''
Functions providing a convenient virtual filesystem.

Among other things, this is how themes and mods will be implemented.
Note that B{all} VFS functions use slash-delimited paths, relieving
other code of the need to C{os.path.join()}.  All VFS paths must also
be absolute (i.e. start with a slash) and may not contain "." or "..".

Files or directories may be mounted in the root of the VFS read-only
or read-write.  Mounting multiple things onto the same mountpoint
overlays the newer mount's contents on the old mount's contents, but
read-write mounts always prevail over read-only mounts in the resolution
order.  All write attempts to a given mountpoint go to the most recent
read-write mount on that mountpoint; trying to write to a mountpoint
that has no writable mounts raises C{OSError(EROFS)}.  Modification of
files existing in lower layers but not the most recent writable mount
uses copy-on-write semantics.  There is no way to make something in
a lower layer appear to have been deleted, however.
