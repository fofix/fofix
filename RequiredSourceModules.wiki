Versions are likely important. Don't substitute one for the other without trying the original versions first. These versions were tested, yours were not. I will not answer questions unless you have done the things in this document.

===Install===

  # Install active python by double clicking the .msi
  # Install psyco by double clicking the .exe
  # Unzip GLEW (no easy install)
  # Install glew by copying the 'glew.dll' file in 'bin' to your 'system32' dir under C:\Windows (or equivalent)
  # Install PyOpenGL by double clicking the .exe
  # Install GLEWpy by double clicking the .exe
  # Install PyGame by double clicking the .exe
  # Install PIL by double clicking the .exe
  # Install Numeric by double clicking the .exe
  # Install Amanith by double clicking the .exe
  # Select reboot later
  # Install PyAmanith by double clicking the .exe
  # Install Pyogg by double clicking the .exe
  # Install Pyvorbis by double clicking the .exe
  # Install py2exe by double clicking the .exe

_This next part fixes a opengl/py2exe bug so it may not be necessary in the future. Only if you get an error when running the FretsOnFire.exe that says:_

{{{
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'D:\\Games\\Frets on Fire\\dist\\data\\library.zip\\OpenGL\\version'
}}}


16. Go to your Python directory and go into the 'Lib' and then 'site-packages' directory
*VERY IMPORTANT*


_In steps 17-20 you must replace the --'s with two underscores. The Wiki does not display underscores directly since they are formatting characters._


17. Go into the 'OpenGL' directory and edit the file called '--init--.py'


18. replace the line that reads:


{{{
--version-- = string.strip(open(filename).read())
}}}


with


{{{
--version-- = '2.0.2.01'
}}}


 19. Save this file

 20. Delete '--init--.pyc' and '--init--.pyo' in the same directory
*VERY IMPORTANT*

_In previous 17-20 you must replace the --'s with two underscores. The Wiki does not display underscores directly since they are formatting characters._

 21. Locate the downloaded or checked-out FoFiX sources

 22. Move the 'src' directory into your FoFiX directory (same place as the 'data' directory) if it is not already located there.

 23. *REBOOT* _(required)_

 24. Open a command prompt

 25. cd to the new 'src' directory in your FoFiX directory

 26. type 'python FretsOnFire.py'

At this point you should be able to play frets on fire directly from the source
To create the executable we need a few more steps

 27. in your command prompt type 'python setup.py py2exe'

 28. a bunch of stuff will happen and you should end up with a 'dist' directory above.

 29. Go into the dist directory and retrieve FretsOnFire.exe, place in your FoFiX trunk / root.

 30. Go into the dist\data directory and retrieve library.zip, place in your FoFiX's data directory.

 31. You may need the Windows support files for FoFiX (mostly .DLLs), which can be found inside any full Windows FoFiX distribution in the appropriate directory structure.
