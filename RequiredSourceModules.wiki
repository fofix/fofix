Versions are likely important. Don't substitute one for the other without trying the original versions first. These versions were tested, yours were not. I will not answer questions unless you have done the things in this document.

  # Download Active Python 2.4.3.12 (not the standard python distro) - [http://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePython/windows/2.4/ActivePython-2.4.3.12-win32-x86.msi]

===Install In This Order===

  #  Install active python by double clicking the .msi
  #  Install psyco by double clicking the .exe
  #  Unzip GLEW (no easy install)
  #  Install glew by copying the 'glew32.dll' file in 'bin' to your 'system32' dir under C:\Windows (or equivalent) (64bit OS users - copy into 'C:\Windows' instead of '\system32')
  #  Install PyOpenGL by double clicking the .exe
  #  Install GLEWpy by double clicking the .exe
  #  Install PyGame by double clicking the .exe
  #  Install PIL by double clicking the .exe
  #  Install Numeric by double clicking the .exe
  # Install Amanith by double clicking the .exe
  # Select reboot later
  # Install PyAmanith by double clicking the .exe
  # Install Pyogg by double clicking the .exe
  # Install Pyvorbis by double clicking the .exe
  # Install py2exe by double clicking the .exe

_This next part fixes a opengl/py2exe bug so it may not be necessary in the future. Only if you get an error when running the FretsOnFire.exe that says:_

{{{
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'D:\\Games\\Frets on Fire\\dist\\data\\library.zip\\OpenGL\\version'
}}}
  # Go to your Python directory and go into the `Lib` and then `site-packages` directory
  # Go into the `OpenGL` directory and edit the file called `__init__.py`
  # Replace the line that reads:
    `__version__ = string.strip(open(filename).read())` *with*
    `__version__ = '2.0.2.01'`
  # Save this file
  # Delete `__init__.pyc` and `__init__.pyo` in the same directory

Back to what we were initially trying:
  # Locate the downloaded or checked-out FoFiX sources
  # Move the {{{src}}} directory into your FoFiX directory (same place as the {{{data}}} directory) if it is not already located there.
  # *REBOOT* _(required)_
  # Open a command prompt
  # cd to the new {{{src}}} directory in your FoFiX directory
  # type {{{python FretsOnFire.py}}} (or run the {{{src\scripts\RunFofFromSources.bat}}} script)

At this point you should be able to play frets on fire directly from the source.

To create the executable we need a few more steps

  # Go to your {{{src\scripts}}} directory where you have your SVN directory setup (IE- {{{C:\FoFiX SVN\src\scripts}}})
  # Double-click on the {{{RebuildWin.bat}}} script.  This will recompile and rebuild the game {{{.EXE}}} file, {{{library.zip}}}, and required Python support modules ({{{.PYD}}} files).  This script will also retrieve these files and replace the old files in your FoFiX and data folders, as well as copy over any {{{.DLL}}} files that the build process decided to include.  Then the intermediate files (in {{{src\build}}} and {{{dist\}}}) will automatically be cleaned up.
  # You may need the Windows support files for FoFiX (mostly {{{.DLL}}}s), which can be found inside any full Windows FoFiX distribution in the appropriate directory structure.

----
==For GNU/Linux==
=== Get latest FoFiX ===
  # Open a terminal
  # Change to the directory in which you want to have FoFiX
  # Execute `svn checkout http://fofix.googlecode.com/svn/MFH-Mod/trunk/ FoFiX-SVN`
=== Install dependencies ===
You need to install those packages:
  * python2.4
  * python-pygame
  * python-opengl (= 2.x)
  * python-numpy
  * python-numeric
  * python-pil
  * python-vorbis

Optionally, if you are in 32bit you can also install python-psyco.

=== Running from sources ===
  # Change directory to `FoFiX-SVN/src`
  # Execute `python2.4 FretsOnFire.py`

=== Creating binaries ===
You first need to...
  # Install cxFreeze
  # Substitue line 16 of `/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/OpenGL/__init__.py` with `__version__ = "2.0.1.09"`.
  # Get the wiki pages by executing the following in the folder that contains `FoFiX-SVN`:
    * `svn checkout http://fofix.googlecode.com/svn/wiki FoFiX-wiki`

Then either create a patch or a full package.

==== Patch ====
  * Execute `make patch`.
==== Full package ====
  # Execute `make dist`.
  # Execute `perl pkg/package-GNULinux.pl -d FoFiX-Full-GNULinux -l pkg/Dist-MegaLight-GNULinux.lst`
