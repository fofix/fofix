This quick tutorial is a modified version of a [http://www.fretsonfire.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=34231&st=0&sk=t&sd=a&sid=c3b5739d1a6c4e02d9ee368375f7951c&start=3045#p415843 post by BlackJack on FoFFF]. Thanks BlackJack!

== Use Case ==
I saw that the translation for my language is missing a whole lot of stuff or worse, FoFiX has not been translated to that language yet! I would be willing to do the translation if someone would explain to me how to do it.

== Procedure == 
In the following, we assume the translation language is German.

  # Download the latest versions of [http://fofix.googlecode.com/svn/MFH-Mod/trunk/src/messages.pot messages.pot] and [http://fofix.googlecode.com/svn/MFH-Mod/trunk/src/tutorial.pot tutorial.pot]
  # Merge the two files together _i.e._ copy the content of `tutorial.pot` in `messages.pot` and save it as `german.po`
  # Edit the `.po` file
    * Any text editor will do but using a `.po` editor is recommended (_e.g._ poedit or gtranslator)
    # Translate every `msgid` in its corresponding `msgstr` (see example below).
    # Update the header with _your_ information (if not already done by you or your editor)
    # Convert your `.po` file into a `.mo` file (using your editor or a tool like gettext)
  # Copy your `.mo` file to the `data/translations` folder of FoFiX
  # Go in-game and check if it's working as expected
  # If so, please [http://code.google.com/p/fofix/issues/entry create an issue] about your translation and add your `.po` and `.mo` files as attachments

=== Translation Example ===
Before:
{{{
  Select all
  msgid "%d points is a new high score! Enter your name:"
  msgstr ""
}}}

After :
{{{
  Select all
  msgid "%d points is a new high score! Enter your name:"
  msgstr "%d Punkte ist ein neuer Highscore! Bitte Namen eingeben :"
}}}

=== Advice ===
  * Don't wait to have everything translated before testing your file in game
  * *MAKE BACKUPS*
