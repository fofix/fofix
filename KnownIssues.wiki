= Introduction =
Please note, we are not currently looking for suggestions. However, just in case you feel the need to suggest or report something, please review the following first.

= Known Issues =
*NOTE* Some of the known issues have existed long before this fork was created.

*NOTE* Our Issues Tracker contains both [http://code.google.com/p/fofix/issues/list?can=2&q=type:Defect enhancement requests, bugs and known issues]. Have a look!

  * Solos in RB - Green Grass & High Tides aren't parsed exactly as they are in the real game [http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=11;t=24664;st=3590#entry291538 detail post]
  * Options are sorted alphabetically; sometimes this is not desirable but this is the way it is.
  * Guitar solos require an unbroken streak to get a 100% - even if you overstrum and hit all the notes, your guitar solo will be forced down to 99.0%. I do not plan to change this; it's like this for a reason, and was tough enough to get working.
  * Browsing a folder with only 4 entries in song "list" mode results in the list jumping up and down - it has been this way for a long time - [http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=24664&st=4660#entry307107 detail post]
  * Sometimes, the game will start with fonts displayed all incorrectly. It has been this way for a long time. Just exit and restart. *Fixed[?]*
  * Any image files (stages, backgrounds, etc) MUST have a lowercase ".png" extension - THE GAME CAN NOT HANDLE CAPITALIZED ".PNG" EXTENSIONS! *Likely Fixed*
  * While in the songlist, the game ignores keypresses while loading a song preview either via the yellow fret or auto preview (of course... just like the game ignores inputs while it's loading anything else)

==About Double-pick problem on guitar controllers!==
When strumming down, up, down, up, ... the game doesn't always register all the picks.
Alarian has the Xbox Xplorer guitar controller and it's safe to say that the problem he's experiencing is caused by the controller!
The "strum-button" on the controller is registered by the computer as "Point of View Hat" and this causes problems since it's not a button that you can release. FoF won't register when you release the button. What I did was to download Xpadder: http://xpadder.com/.
You can link the "strum-button" to 2 keys on the keyboard instead, this solved my problem. 

==About Variable/Speed-dependent Hitwindow==
Set the hitwindow to tight and tweak the A/V-Delay so it's right when you hit the notes when listening to the music. This is now easy with the new Accuracy indicator.
Remember that the correct A/V-Delay is different on every computer depending on system, prestanda and audio-settings. 

= Unconfirmed Bug Reports =
*NOTE* We have not been able to reproduce any of these, so to us, these bugs do not exist.
