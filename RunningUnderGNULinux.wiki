=Getting FoFiX=
You are required to have the {{{svn}}} client.
  # Open a terminal
  # Change to the directory in which you want to have FoFiX
  # Execute one of the following depending on the version you want:
    # Stable: {{{svn checkout http://fofix.googlecode.com/svn/MFH-Mod/tags/Release_3.100 fofix-3.100}}}
    # Testing: {{{svn checkout http://fofix.googlecode.com/svn/MFH-Mod/tags/Release_3.120_rc1 fofix-3.120~rc1}}}
    # Unstable: {{{svn checkout http://fofix.googlecode.com/svn/MFH-Mod/trunk/ fofix-svn}}}

_It is highly recommended that when you use the unstable version (when you become an Alpha tester), you keep a separate FoFiX folder containing a full install of the latest stable release - as the Alpha versions' new features and bugfixes might cause other issues affecting playability._

_Alternatively, be familiar with your svn clients method of rolling back to previous revisions so you can downgrade to a working revision if the latest one breaks on you e.g. at the commandline, you may use {{{svn up -r<revision_number>}}} to rollback to the specified version._

= Install dependencies =
You need to install these packages:
  * Python (tested with 2.4 and 2.5)
  * pygame (>= 1.9 required for 64bit CPUs)
  * PyOpenGL (2.x is recommanded as it's much faster than 3.x for most users)
  * NumPy
  * (Python) Numeric
  * Python Imaging Library (PIL)
  * PyOgg
  * PyVorbis
  * PySqlite2
  * PyXML

Optionally, if you are in 32bit you can also install Psyco.

=== Optional Voice Support ===
  # Build pyaudio.
  # Build pypitch.

_Detailed instructions still to come._

=== Optional PitchBending ===
==== Requirements ====
In order to build John Stumpo's pitchbend module you first need to install...
  * libsdl-mixer1.2-dev
  * libsndobj-dev

==== Compiling ====
  # Get the source code: {{{svn co https://svn.stump.jstump.com/svnroot/pitchbend/trunk pitchbend}}}
  # Move to the source folder: {{{cd pitchbend}}}
  # Create an empty VERSION file: {{{touch VERSION}}}
  # Build the library: {{{python setup.py build}}}
  # Optionally you can install it: {{{sudo python setup.py install}}}

== Debian and Ubuntu ==
Execute the following as root to install the dependencies:
{{{
apt-get install python-pygame python-opengl python-numpy python-imaging python-ogg python-pyvorbis python-pysqlite2 python-xml python2.5-dev
}}}

Notes:
  * *If you are running in a 64bit environment, pygame >= 1.9 is required*. You'll need to build it yourself. Note that you don't have to install it, you can use the PYTHONPATH environment variable to point python to your pygame library (see below for an example).

  * Under Debian unstable, make sure you have python-pyvorbis 1.3 or >= 1.4-2 but not 1.4-1. The latter crashes with a double free error.

=== Getting and installing pygame 1.9.1 ===
{{{
wget http://www.pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.1release.tar.gz
tar xvf pygame-1.9.1release.tar.gz
cd pygame-1.9.1release/
sudo python2.5 setup.py
}}}

= Running the game =
  # Change directory to the `src` folder of your FoFiX directory _e.g._ `~/fofix-svn/src`.
  # Execute {{{python FoFiX.py}}}

*Note*: If you are using custom built but not installed libraries, use the PYTHONPATH environment variable _e.g._
{{{
PYTHONPATH=~/pygame-1.9.1release/build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.5:~/pyaudio/build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.5 python FoFiX.py
}}}
