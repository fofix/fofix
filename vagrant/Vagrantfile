  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.

  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
